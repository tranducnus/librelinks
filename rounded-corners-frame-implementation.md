# Rounded Corners Frame Template Implementation

## Implementation Details

- Created a new frame template component `RoundedCornersFrame` that supports various corner styles (Notch, Scoop, Bevel, Diamond, Straight, Round, Squircle, Apple)
- Implemented SVG path generation for different corner styles
- Created a customization UI with corner style selection, border radius controls, and individual corner radius adjustments
- Updated the frame selector, avatar components, and frame customizer to support the new frame template
- Added new fields to the User schema for storing the rounded corners frame properties
- Updated API endpoints to handle the new frame properties

## Lessons Learned

1. **SVG Path Generation**: Implementing different corner styles required understanding SVG path commands. Each corner style needed a different approach to generate the appropriate path.

2. **Component Integration**: Adding a new frame template required updates to multiple components:

   - The frame template component itself
   - The frame selector for choosing the template
   - The avatar components for rendering the frame
   - The frame customizer for adjusting the frame properties

3. **Database Schema Evolution**: Adding new features often requires extending the database schema. It's important to provide default values for new fields to ensure backward compatibility.

4. **API Validation**: When adding new API parameters, it's crucial to implement proper validation to ensure data integrity.

5. **UI Consistency**: The new UI elements should match the existing design system for a consistent user experience.

6. **Performance Considerations**: For complex SVG rendering, caching and optimization techniques are important to maintain good performance.

## Future Improvements

1. **Additional Corner Styles**: More corner styles could be added in the future.

2. **Preview Optimization**: The preview rendering could be optimized for better performance.

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the customization UI works well on mobile devices.

4. **Animation Integration**: Better integration with the existing animation system.

5. **Gradient Support**: Add support for gradient colors in the frame.

## Technical Notes

- SVG paths are generated dynamically based on the selected corner style and radius values
- The frame cache key includes all relevant properties to ensure proper caching
- The API validates all input parameters to prevent invalid values
- Default values are provided for all new properties to ensure backward compatibility

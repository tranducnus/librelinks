## Theme System Implementation

### Color Synchronization (Link Cards)

- The theme system uses a palette with four key colors:

  - `theme.primary` - Background color
  - `theme.secondary` - Secondary background color
  - `theme.accent` - Text color (used for profile name and interactive elements)
  - `theme.neutral` - Border/neutral color

- When implementing theme-based styling:
  - Use `theme.accent` for text and interactive elements that should match the profile name
  - Maintain consistency across components by referencing the same theme properties
  - Consider accessibility when choosing theme colors

### Lessons Learned

1. Theme Consistency: When adding new UI elements, always check if they should follow the theme's color scheme
2. Style Inheritance: When modifying styles, preserve existing style properties by using object spread or combining them in the style object
3. Component Cohesion: Related elements (like title and chevron) should use the same theme colors for visual consistency

### Future Considerations

- When adding new interactive elements, consider if they should follow the theme's accent color
- Test new theme-related changes across all available themes to ensure consistency
- Consider adding theme color validation to ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

# Padding Customization Feature

## Overview

The padding customization feature allows users to fine-tune the spacing between various elements in their profile page. This includes:

- Distance from page head to profile picture
- Distance between profile picture and name
- Spacing between link cards
- Height/padding of link cards

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

```prisma
model User {
  // ... other fields ...
  headToPicturePadding Int @default(40)
  pictureToNamePadding Int @default(16)
  betweenCardsPadding Int @default(16)
  linkCardHeight Int @default(16)
}
```

### API Endpoint

The `/api/customize` endpoint handles padding updates through a PATCH request:

```javascript
{
  headToPicturePadding: number,
  pictureToNamePadding: number,
  betweenCardsPadding: number,
  linkCardHeight: number
}
```

### Components

- `PaddingSelector`: Main component for adjusting padding values
- Preview updates in real-time through React Query and iframe signaling
- Values range from 0px to 200px in 5px increments

### Usage Example

```jsx
<PaddingSelector />
```

### Best Practices

1. Always use the default values as fallbacks
2. Ensure padding changes are reflected immediately in previews
3. Use consistent units (px) throughout the application
4. Maintain mobile responsiveness with padding changes

### Notes

- Padding values are saved per-user in the database
- Changes are immediately reflected in both mobile and desktop previews
- The feature maintains compatibility with all themes
- All padding values use pixels for consistency

## Profile Picture Size Customization

### Implementation Details

- Added profile picture size customization feature
- Size range: 20px to 500px in 20px increments
- Immediate updates without transitions
- Server-side validation ensures size stays within bounds

### Components

- `ImageSizeSelector`: New component in `components/core/custom-image-sizes/`
- Integrated with existing avatar components
- Uses existing mutation patterns for updates
- Preview updates handled through existing preview components

### Validation Rules

- Client-side: Dropdown limits selection to valid sizes
- Server-side: Validates size between 20px and 500px
- Type checking ensures size is a number
- Error responses for invalid sizes

### Usage

1. Navigate to Settings page
2. Find the Profile Picture Size dropdown
3. Select desired size (20px to 500px)
4. Changes apply immediately to all previews
5. Invalid sizes are prevented by both client and server validation

### Technical Notes

- No transition animations implemented (as per requirements)
- No preset sizes included (as per requirements)
- No special image optimization needed
- Uses existing preview refresh mechanisms

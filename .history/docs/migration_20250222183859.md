# Migration Guide

## Profile Frame Customization Feature

This guide covers the steps needed to upgrade your application to support the new profile frame customization feature.

### Database Changes

1. Add new columns to the User model:

```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields ...
  profileFrameType String @default("circle")
  profileFrameColor String @default("#3B82F6")
}
```

2. Run database migrations:

```bash
# Generate the migration
npx prisma generate

# Apply the migration
npx prisma db push
```

### Breaking Changes

1. Avatar Components

- The `Avatar.Root` component now expects frame-related props
- The default border styling has been moved to the frame system
- Existing custom border styles may need to be updated

2. API Changes

- The `/api/customize` endpoint now accepts new parameters
- Existing calls to this endpoint should continue to work as before
- New validation rules are in place for frame types and colors

### Upgrade Steps

1. Database Migration

```bash
# Backup your database
mongodump --db your_database_name

# Apply the new schema
npx prisma db push

# Verify the migration
npx prisma studio
```

2. Component Updates

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Build the project to check for any breaking changes
npm run build
```

3. Code Updates

- Update any custom avatar components to use the new frame system
- Review and update any direct API calls to `/api/customize`
- Update any tests that involve avatar components or customization

### Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Database Rollback

```bash
# Restore database backup
mongorestore --db your_database_name path_to_backup

# Revert schema changes
# (Keep a backup of the current schema.prisma before reverting)
```

2. Code Rollback

```bash
# Revert to the previous version
git checkout <previous_version>

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild the project
npm run build
```

### Post-Migration Tasks

1. Verify that all avatar components display correctly
2. Test frame type selection in the settings page
3. Test frame color selection in the settings page
4. Verify that changes persist after page reload
5. Check mobile responsiveness
6. Test across different browsers

### Known Issues

1. Frame Shapes

- Some complex frame shapes (heart, polygons) may render differently across browsers
- Mobile devices may have slight variations in shape rendering

2. Color Picker

- Some browsers may show slight variations in color display
- Mobile color pickers may have platform-specific behaviors

### Support

If you encounter any issues during migration:

1. Check the error logs
2. Review the component documentation
3. Test in a development environment first
4. Contact support if issues persist

### Future Considerations

1. Performance

- Monitor performance impact of complex frame shapes
- Consider implementing frame shape caching if needed

2. Browser Support

- Keep track of browser-specific rendering issues
- Plan for fallback shapes on unsupported browsers

3. Customization

- Consider adding custom frame shape support
- Plan for additional color selection methods

## Theme System Implementation

### Color Synchronization (Link Cards)

- The theme system uses a palette with four key colors:

  - `theme.primary` - Background color
  - `theme.secondary` - Secondary background color
  - `theme.accent` - Text color (used for profile name and interactive elements)
  - `theme.neutral` - Border/neutral color

- When implementing theme-based styling:
  - Use `theme.accent` for text and interactive elements that should match the profile name
  - Maintain consistency across components by referencing the same theme properties
  - Consider accessibility when choosing theme colors

### Lessons Learned

1. Theme Consistency: When adding new UI elements, always check if they should follow the theme's color scheme
2. Style Inheritance: When modifying styles, preserve existing style properties by using object spread or combining them in the style object
3. Component Cohesion: Related elements (like title and chevron) should use the same theme colors for visual consistency

### Future Considerations

- When adding new interactive elements, consider if they should follow the theme's accent color
- Test new theme-related changes across all available themes to ensure consistency
- Consider adding theme color validation to ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

# Padding Customization Feature

## Overview

The padding customization feature allows users to fine-tune the spacing between various elements in their profile page. This includes:

- Distance from page head to profile picture
- Distance between profile picture and name
- Spacing between link cards
- Height/padding of link cards

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

```prisma
model User {
  // ... other fields ...
  headToPicturePadding Int @default(40)
  pictureToNamePadding Int @default(16)
  betweenCardsPadding Int @default(16)
  linkCardHeight Int @default(16)
}
```

### API Endpoint

The `/api/customize` endpoint handles padding updates through a PATCH request:

```javascript
{
  headToPicturePadding: number,
  pictureToNamePadding: number,
  betweenCardsPadding: number,
  linkCardHeight: number
}
```

### Components

- `PaddingSelector`: Main component for adjusting padding values
- Preview updates in real-time through React Query and iframe signaling
- Values range from 0px to 200px in 5px increments

### Usage Example

```jsx
<PaddingSelector />
```

### Best Practices

1. Always use the default values as fallbacks
2. Ensure padding changes are reflected immediately in previews
3. Use consistent units (px) throughout the application
4. Maintain mobile responsiveness with padding changes

### Notes

- Padding values are saved per-user in the database
- Changes are immediately reflected in both mobile and desktop previews
- The feature maintains compatibility with all themes
- All padding values use pixels for consistency

# Project Learnings and Documentation

## Bio Description Display

### Changes Made (2024)

- Removed text truncation from bio display in both main profile and preview components
- Added proper text wrapping with `break-words` and `whitespace-normal`
- Maintained mobile-first design with responsive widths
- Added horizontal padding for better text spacing

### Key Considerations

1. Text Display

   - Bio text should be fully visible without truncation
   - Text wrapping should work naturally on all screen sizes
   - Padding ensures text doesn't touch container edges

2. Responsive Design

   - Mobile: w-[150px] width constraint
   - Desktop: lg:w-[500px] or lg:w-[600px] width constraint
   - Font size is configurable through bioFontSize setting

3. Component Consistency
   - Changes must be synchronized between [handle].jsx and preview-mobile.jsx
   - Preview should accurately reflect the actual profile display

### Future Considerations

1. Consider implementing dynamic width based on font size
2. Monitor long bio text impact on overall layout
3. Consider adding optional max-height with "show more" functionality if needed
4. Keep preview component in sync with any future profile display changes

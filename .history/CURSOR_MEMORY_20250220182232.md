# Project Lessons & Guidelines

## Dynamic Content Scaling

- Provider-specific handling is crucial for embedded content
- Mobile and desktop previews require different padding and constraints
- ResizeObserver is more efficient than window resize events for container-based scaling
- Debouncing resize calculations improves performance
- Error boundaries are essential for graceful fallbacks
- Transition animations should be smooth but not interfere with content loading
- Container width should be the primary reference for scaling calculations
- Aspect ratio preservation is critical for visual consistency

## Best Practices

- Always clean up observers and event listeners
- Use provider-specific configuration objects for maintainability
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Add comprehensive error handling for embed failures
- Document scaling behavior and provider requirements
- Test with various content types and screen sizes
- Monitor performance impact of scaling operations

## Known Provider Requirements

### Instagram

- Requires embed.js script
- Needs blockquote wrapper
- Maintains specific aspect ratios

### Spotify

- Fixed height for certain content types
- Responsive width scaling
- Specific padding requirements

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for provider API changes
- Consider adding new provider support
- Optimize for different device capabilities
- Regular performance audits
- Update documentation as requirements change
